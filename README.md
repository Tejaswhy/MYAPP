SafeGo is an Android application originally developed for the Smart India Hackathon as a smart-city safety and assistance tool, combining emergency SOS features, smart maps, weather information, transportation guidance, heritage details, and basic AI support in one interface. Although the app is not yet fully complete, it already includes essential modules such as SOS alerts, location-based services, and multiple UI screens, and I am actively working on improving its functionality, adding more intelligent features, and polishing the user experience. This project reflects an ongoing effort to build a practical, real-world safety companion using modern Android development tools and APIs.
